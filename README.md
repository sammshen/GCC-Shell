A simple shell with two modes:   
  1) Interactive Mode: REPL  
  2) Batch Mode: Scripts  
Design Features   
- Homemade C hashmap and enum matches user jobs to create an extensible command database  
- Separates into jobs (delimited by ;) and then arguments (delimited by spaces or tabs etc)  
- Handles redirection  

Learnings from this project:  
- Custom Data Structures in C  
- execvp, waitpid, fork()    
- specifically, the implementation of ls  
- implementation of redir
